# Pythonology

git clone https://github.com/go2salimm/Pythonology.git

# Debugging
pdb.set_trace()
Commands:
    c: continue execution
    w: shows the context of the current line it is executing.
    a: print the argument list of the current function
    s: Execute the current line and stop at the first possible occasion.
    n: Continue execution until the next line in the current function is reached or it returns.

# Generators
an iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists. 
iterable -->  __iter__ or __getitem__ 
iterator -->  next or __next__
iteration --> looping 
Generators are iterators.  You iterate over them once.  They generate the values on the fly and yield.


# Map, Filter, Reduce, Lambda
map applies a function to all the items in the inputlist:  map(function_to_apply, list_of_inputs)
filter creates a list of elements for which a function returns true
reduce is a useful function for performing computation on a list and returning the result
lambda argument : manipulate(argument)

# set , defaultdict, OrderedDict
Sets behave mostly like lists but they cannot contain duplicate values.
with defaultdict you do not need to check whether a key is present or not. Useful when appending to nested list inside a dictionary.
OrderedDict keeps its entries sorted as they are initially inserted. 
Overwriting a value of an existing key doesn’t change the position of that key. However, deleting and reinserting an entry moves the key to the end of the dictionary.

# comprehensions
3 types : list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, set comprehensions
similar syntax for list and set comprehensions.

# decorators
Decorators let you execute code before and after a function. 
Decorators wrap a function and modify its behavior
eg. def a_new_decorator(func):
    @a_new_decorator
    def b_func()   
 equals b_func = a_new_decorator(b_func)
 

# Mutation
In Python the default arguments are evaluated once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. 
You should never define default arguments of mutable type unless you know what you are doing.

# __slots__
By default Python uses a dict to store an object’s instance attributes. 
However, for small classes with known attributes it might be a bottleneck. The dict wastes a lot of RAM. 
__slots__ tells Python not to use a dict, and only allocate space for a fixed set of attributes.


# virtual envs
virtualenv! creates isolated environments for your python application 
It allows you to install Python libraries in that isolated environment instead of installing them globally so
you can have specific version of the libraries for your app.

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv SMProject
source bin/activate
virtualenv --system-site-packages myproject
deactivate

Running python after deactivating will use your system installation of Python again.
