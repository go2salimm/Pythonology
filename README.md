# Generators
an iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists. 
iterable -->  __iter__ or __getitem__ 
iterator -->  next or __next__
iteration --> looping 
Generators are iterators.  You iterate over them once.  They generate the values on the fly and yield.
