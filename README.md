# Generators
an iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists. 
iterable -->  __iter__ or __getitem__ 
iterator -->  next or __next__
iteration --> looping 
Generators are iterators.  You iterate over them once.  They generate the values on the fly and yield.


# Map, Filter and Reduce
map applies a function to all the items in the inputlist:  map(function_to_apply, list_of_inputs)
filter creates a list of elements for which a function returns true
reduce is a useful function for performing computation on a list and returning the result
